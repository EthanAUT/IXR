      <summary>Week 3</summary>
      In week three we continued to use gravity sketch, getting more familiar with the available tools and their unique quirks when working in a virtual space. This also led some students to experience one fo the major issues associated with VR, that being motion sickness, and had to step out of the headset for breaks.
